Category Detection using Amazon Queries
What is Intent Detection?
Category detection involves analyzing and categorizing user utterances into predefined categories or labels that represent different categories of information or topics. These categories can vary depending on the application or domain. For example, in a news categorization system, categories might include "sports," "politics," "entertainment," or "technology." The goal is to accurately identify the appropriate category for each user input, allowing for efficient organization and retrieval of relevant information.
Why BERT for Category Detection?
BERT is typically pretrained on a large corpus of text data using unsupervised learning. This pretraining enables BERT to learn general language representations that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks like intent detection.
BERT's bidirectional nature allows it to capture contextual information effectively. It can understand the meaning of a word based on its surrounding words, which is beneficial for intent detection, as it enables the model to consider the full context of the user query
The below dataset should cover a wide range of intents and include representative examples of user inputs.
